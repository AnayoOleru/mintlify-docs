## About LeafletUI

LeafletUi aims to provide lightweight, reusable, and clean React and React Native UI components that make it faster and easier for developers to build mobile and web apps without relying on heavy UI libraries or spending hours styling from scratch 

### Key Goals for React native
```
1. Offer simple, ready-to-use components for React Native.
2. Keep the bundle lightweight and fast.
3. Ensure compatibility with Expo and React Native CLI.
4. Reduce repetitive styling work for developers.
5. Encourage clean, composable UI patterns.
```
